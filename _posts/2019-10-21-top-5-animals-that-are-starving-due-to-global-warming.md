title: Top 5 animals that are starving due to global warming
---

All of us are aware of the fact that global warming is detrimental to almost all species in the planet. While global warming is directly associated with warming of temperature and increase in water level, less do we talk about its impact on the food ecosystem of certain animals. Here is a list of the top 5 animals that are starving due to global warming and are at risk from climate change.

## Polar bear
Polar bears are one of the species worst affected by global warming. We are all aware that global warming is melting the arctic ice but there is still enough ice sheet around in the polar region. If that’s the case, then why do the bears starve?

 Polar bears against popular belief are very active creatures, in the sense, they burn a lot of calories per day. Hence, they need to consume lot of food to keep up their body mass. The species that provides them the most is the seal. A polar bear typically hunts a seal by waiting for it to come to shore then once the seal is on shore the bear stands on its hind legs and hammers in a deadly blow with its front paws.
 
 Now with the increasing temperature the ice sheets have become thin and begin to float far earlier in the year than usual. This makes the polar bear travel far distances by land or by water to reach the potential prey. Not many polar bears are successful at this and they are not built for this too. It pains most of us to see a powerful predator starve as in the [video from National Geographic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhaVNJb3ag) and let’s hope that our acts to improve global warming help reviving the species and reduces the effect of climate change that is upon them now.

## Rein deer

The species that symbolizes Christmas has not been spared by global warming too. The species is found in the northern part of the planet, in large numbers in the Norwegian archipelago of [Svalbard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Svalbard). The increase in global temperature has impacted this region more than the rest of planet. There has been an increase of temperature by 3.7 deg Celsius in this region against the global increase of 1C in the last century. Their population is threatened due to increased rainfall and flooding that is uncharacteristic in this land of snow leading to loss of food. The newborn and the weak are the most affecting thus leading to an ageing population of the species threatening its existence. 


## Koala Bear
Unlike the species above that are impacted due to melting snow the koala bear doesn’t even live near ice. It thrives in the hotter parts of Australia. While an increase in temperature by a few degrees may not impact this [cute creature](toknowisgood.com/2019/02/12/top-six-cutest-animals-in-the-world.html) , its dependence on a single food source does. The koala bear almost entirely depends on eucalyptus leaves for its food, but this plant species is extremely vulnerable to increase in temperature. The tree is also slow growing and hence losing too many trees to global warming would be catastrophic to the koala bear. This makes the koala one of the most endangered by climate change.
