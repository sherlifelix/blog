But it also doesn’t mean that these are the nations with the most number of islands. Let us look at the top 4 countries with the most number of islands. This might provide new holiday destination goals for many travelers.


## Sweden:

This Scandinavian country has the most number of islands estimated to be 221800. That’s right, So sure that would not have been anybody’s guess. The interesting fact is that only around 1000 of these islands are inhabited. The reason for this could be due to the fact that the country faces extreme Arctic weather and the other key factor could be the extremely low population density of only 22 inhabitants per square kilometer. Around 65% of the total forest area is covered with forests. These forests are with a dense vegetation of trees unlike the grasslands found in Africa and hence support unique wildlife. Not all the islands are huge in size and hence have become sites for adventurers and other water sport enthusiasts.

## Finland:
