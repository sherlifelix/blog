 How did this combination happen? 
 	The answer to this lies in the Arabian sea. After so many years there were multiple cyclones in the Arabian sea over 2018 and 2019. This lead to unusual but plentiful downpour in the Saharan and Arab peninsula. Such downpour helped form temporary water resource helping the locust breed better. So over the past year over multiple generations the locusts multiplied and when the dry season started hitting them, they had to form swarms in search of greener pastures. This led them all the way from East Africa to the Indian subcontinent. Is there a way to control them and if so why was it not done upfront.

There could be two answers to this question : One is the area where the locusts breed are not accessible and the countries too do not have the resources in place to cull the breeding of these crop destroyers. Another answer could be in the behavior of the locusts. The locusts are not always so aggressive. When solitary they remain to be the green humble grown up version of a grasshopper. It is when they become part of a swarm or when too many locusts are together closely packed that they turn gregarious in nature and form such invading swarms. Countries are struggling to control this swarm of 2020 and if global warming is truly the reason behind this then we can expect many more to come in the future as well
