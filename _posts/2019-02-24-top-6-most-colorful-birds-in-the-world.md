There are about 10,000 different species of birds found in the wild and they come in different sizes and shapes. They are present in all continents with most of them centered around the tropics. Two key features that set birds apart from other animals are [their wings](https://www.toknowisgood.com/2019/02/21/top-5-birds-with-the-longest-wingspan.html) and feathers/ plumage. The feathers often define the bird’s look and some species turn out to be extremely colorful. Here is a list of birds that we find are the most colorful in the world.

## Keel Billed Toucan

To start of this incredible list, we have the keel billed Toucan. This beauty of a bird calls the rain forests of Central and South America home and is the national bird of Belize. The color of the bird is primarily black with a bright yellow neck and chest. The toucan’s most significant or striking feature is its beak. The beak of the keel billed toucan is almost one-third its length. While the bill or beak of the toucan looks quite heavy, the entire weight of the bird is only about 500 grams. The reason behind this is that the beak is made of a hollow bone covered in Keratin (hard but light protein). The keel billed toucans are very social and are often spotted in small flocks in their habitats. 

## Golden Pheasant

It is the male of this species that boasts the bright colors and claiming the name ‘golden’ to its name while the females have in general black and brown plumage. The striking golden crest combined with the orange and bright red plumage make the golden pheasant one of the most colorful birds in the world. One interesting fact is that in spite of their striking colors they are very difficult to spot in the wild. Part of this can be attributed to the dense forests they thrive in and the little that is known about this bird is mostly known from studying the ones in Zoos and Aviaries.

## Resplendent Quetzal

The resplendent Quetzal is another striking bird.

They are found in the woodlands of the continents but have recently been introduced to other parts of the continent too. They are very distinctive with their blue head, bright orange red chest and green wings. They are highly social beings but are generally spotted in pairs. The lorikeets have been quite effective at surviving in varied environments like Western Australia and New Zealand but however have been considered as pests and threat to indigenous species in some of the areas released and hence have recaptured.
