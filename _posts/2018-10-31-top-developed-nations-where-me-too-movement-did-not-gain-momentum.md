## France

Although several actors and prominent celebrities came forward with their incidents the country has not taken stringent actions on many incidents. Part of it can be blamed on the existing laws. For example France does not have an American equivalent to Equal rights commission where the French women can register their sexual harassment complaints. Also a petition was signed by more than 100000citizens demanding the government to take sexual allegations more seriously. Having said that there have been actions taken to a certain extent against the accused.

## Italy

Another European nation where the movement hasnâ€™t really taken off is the Mediterranean nation of Italy. Many senior leaders and film fraternity had been accused of sexual harassment but no action had been taken against them

## Germany

Germany did not actively support or adopt the metoo movement until recently. There have been accusations of cover up by senior officials but the nation is slowly opening up to the movement

## Israel

Though the movement became popular in the nation, in Israel the accused often escape punishment. The status of the accused remains changed unlike that in the United States
