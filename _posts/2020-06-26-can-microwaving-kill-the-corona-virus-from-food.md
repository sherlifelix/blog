title: Can microwaving kill the corona virus from food?
---

The medical world is rigorously working round the clock to find a vaccine for the novel corona virus. (Vaccine) Unfortunately it is still time away and getting the vaccine manufactured for a vast majority of the population of the world is another Herculean task. So the [novel corona virus](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019) is here to stay with us for some time. The world cannot afford to come to a stand still until that time and hence all economic activities must resume. We have become so dependent on take away and [ordering food online](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/technology-media-and-telecommunications/our-insights/the-changing-market-for-food-delivery#) now and this will continue in the coming months too.Hence one of the key questions that arises in the mind of people is how to ensure that there is no corona virus in the food ordered.

We have studies indicating that the corona virus can stay active on metal for around 5 days, plastic and stainless steel for more than 48 hours and in cardboard for around 24 hours. So, one should not just worry about the virus being present in the food but also the package in which it arrives. Once the package is dealt with in a safe manner, what are the chances that the virus is present inside the food (CDC). The chances of virus being present on the food is higher than inside the cooked food.
