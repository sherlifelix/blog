- News Paper Reporter

The news paper companies are already feeling the pressure in the new digital world. With the evolution of digital media the number of freelance journalists has also increased and they get paid for their work by these digital media. At the same time the ad revenue of printed media is decreasing too. So it might soon be not possible for these printed media houses to sustain the cost incurred by employing so many full time reporters.

So many of the small agencies that were relying on walk ins have run out of business. Only a player with significant online presence would be able to survive in this business in the long run.

As more and more importance is being given to green and global warming, there will be more bans imposed on logging. This would directly impact thousands of laborers working in this field.
