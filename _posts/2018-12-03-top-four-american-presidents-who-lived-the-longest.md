We all know that Donald Trump is the oldest to have been elected. But there quite the number of US presidents that have lived longer than Trump but after their service. There are few who lived long enough to get close to 100 years old. Here is a list of top US presidents that have lived the longest so far:

## George H W Bush

George Bush Sr. as he was called by the people to distinguish him from his eldest son was the 41st President of the United States. He was a prominent member of the Republican Party and was the Vice President before assuming the President’s office in 1989. Bush adopted an aggressive foreign policy which in turn led to slower economic development in the nation. George Bush Sr. lost his next presidential election to the beloved young Bill Clinton in 1993. The scion of the Bush family breathed his last on Nov 30 2018 having lived for 94 years.

## Jimmy Carter

Jimmy Carter is the only living President in the list. He is also 94 years old and is the longest living retired President. He was a Democrat and he led the United States on its road to recovery after the great depression of 1970s. Carter was the 39th President of the United States with his tenure between 1977 and 1981.

## Gerald Ford

Gerald Ford, the 38th President of the United States is third in the list having lived 93 years. A republican, Ford was often at odds with his party members for having moderate views on issues than his counterparts. Among his many actions the one which stood out was the pardon of Richard Nixon for his role in Watergate scandal.

## Ronald Reagan

Ronald Reagan was the 40th President of the United States and has been the most successful of all the presidents in the list having served two complete terms from 1981 – 1989. At the time of his departure he had the highest ratings of approval from the public. Also what sets Reagan apart is that he was an actor before entering active politics. His period oversaw America’s great recovery in economy and thus was revered by his people and his conservative party men. Reagan was diagnosed with Alzheimers which made him inactive in his later years and lived for 93 years before breathing his last in June 2004.

Hopefully there are many more presidents who live long to break this record for 'longest surviving president' in the future
