George Bush Sr. as he was called by the people to distinguish him from his eldest son was the 41st President of the United States. He was a prominent member of the Republican Party and was the Vice President before assuming the President’s office in 1989. Bush adopted an aggressive foreign policy which in turn led to slower economic development in the nation. George Bush Sr. lost his next presidential election to the beloved young Bill Clinton in 1993.  The scion of the Bush family breathed his last on Nov 30 2018 having lived for 94 years.

Gerald Ford, the 38th President of the United States is third in the list having lived 93 years. A republican, Ford was often at odds with his party members for having moderate views on issues than his counterparts.

Ronald Reagan was the 40th President of the United States and has been the most successful of all the presidents in the list having served two complete terms from 1981 – 1989. At the time of his departure he had the highest ratings of approval from the public. Also what sets Reagan apart is that he was an actor before entering active politics. His period oversaw America’s great recovery in economy and thus was revered by his people and his conservative party men. Reagan was diagnosed with Alzheimers which made him inactive in his later years and lived for 93 years before breathing his last in June 2004.
