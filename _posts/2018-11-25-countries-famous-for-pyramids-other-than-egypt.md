## Sudan:
Did you know? Sudan has more number of Pyramids than Egypt. Once known as the region of Nubia, Sudan has pyramids that are similar in structure to those in Egypt but smaller in Size. What they lack in size they make up for it in number. A recent drone footage exposed some 220 pyramids in Sudan that are away still from tourist glare.

## Mexico:
Like Egypt, Mexico has its fair share of gigantic pyramids. Infact the largest man made pyramid is in Mexico! The great pyramid of cholula is its name and is located in Puebla. Though its not as tall as the pyramids in Giza, the pyramid is very wide making it the largest. Infact its so large that the Spanish colonists mistook it for a hill and built a church on top of the grassy pyramid. The third largest pyramid in the world, Teotihuacan,(Pyramid of the sun) also finds its home  in Mexico. The pyramid is different from the ones in Egypt in terms of architecture and was once used as a temple for worship

## China:
The pyramid mausoleum of the first Qin emporer!! You may not have heard of this but would have definitely heard about the terracotta warriors of China. Yes, the warriors are present inside the not yet completely excavated pyramid mausoleum of the Qin emporer. The pyramid is covered in grass and trees and hence may not present a grand sight from the outside. But once you see whats inside, it will blow your mind away. The tomb of the emporer is too not excavated.
