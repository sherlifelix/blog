Most of us eagerly look forward to the holiday season every year. Be it the break from our hectic schedule or the shopping, we all look forward to something that part of the year. Of all reasons, it’s the nostalgia and memories that we look forward to the most. Some of us even get to meet and spend quality time with our family during Christmas. The spirit of joy glows brightly through our Christmas traditions and passes on the joy of Christmas to our next generation. However global warming with its evil claws has not spared the traditions of Christmas too. 

Here is a list of top 4 Christmas traditions that are under threat due to global warming

## Christmas tree
One of the first images that strikes our mind when we think of Christmas is that of a beautifully decorated Christmas tree. The availability of Christmas trees for decoration will be doubtful in the next few decades if global warming is not kept in check. While at present there is no grave danger to the existence of [pine trees](https://www.toknowisgood.com/2019/09/26/did-you-know-these-facts-about-conifers.html), several pine tree farms have already taken a hit in their productivity. Numerous reasons from floods, heat wave and parasite attacks are taking a toll on these farms. Increase in parasite attacks due to global warming are not seen in just crops/ trees but [humans too](https://www.toknowisgood.com/2019/08/10/top-4-diseases-that-are-on-the-rise-due-to-global-warming.html). This implies saving Christmas feeling too depends on our efforts to curb global warming.

## Snowy Christmas
What is almost common to almost all the [Christmas](https://americanliterature.com/christmas) stories we know of ? Well obviously it’s the snow. 
Be it Santa Claus or the home alone movies, we can’t separate snow from Christmas. Though most part of Southern Earth is not covered in snow, even the folks down there celebrate Christmas with artificial Christmas trees covered with cotton or white spray to resemble snow. However, the people in the northern hemisphere who were fortunate enough all these years to experience snow during Christmas are now looking at many Christmas holidays without snow. The reason? Global warming of course. Global warming has altered the weather pattern and in many states in the USA and some parts of Europe could stop seeing snow altogether if global warming is not kept under control. [The weather institutions](https://www.climate.gov/news-features/featured-images/are-you-dreaming-white-christmashave) already started predicting if there will be snow for Christmas and let’s hope there will be for years to come.

## Hot Cocoa
Irrespective of the fact whether its snowing outside or not, we all enjoy sipping a hot cup of chocolate/ cocoa during the Christmas winter. Global warming is trying to devoid us of that pleasure too. Almost 50% of the world’s chocolate production is dependent on two African nations namely [Ghana and Coate De Ivore](https://www.eenews.net/assets/2011/10/03/document_cw_01.pdf) The increasing temperature is playing hardball with the farmers there, restricting the area every passing year that can be deemed suitable for cocoa cultivation. This sad situation can to an extent addressed by few [farming techniques](https://www.toknowisgood.com/2019/10/30/top-4-technologies-that-will-help-farmers-fight-global-warming.html) but cannot totally protect from the ill effects of global warming. This shows how something as trivial as chocolate is not spared by global warming. If nothing is done even the simple [hot chocolate](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/climate-change-could-melt-chocolate-production/) could become a drink of the rich.

## Maple syrup and Pancake
We all wake up on Christmas to a sumptuous breakfast of pancakes and [maple syrup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maple_syrup). Maple syrup extraction is a very tedious process and the syrup is actually extracted from the sap of the maple tree. The tree is able to produce the sap because of specific climatic pattern that exists in the region where it grows. Increasing temperature or any weather change will greatly impact maple syrup production. It won’t  just impact production but there are [economies that depend on maple syrup](https://www.forbes.com/sites/nicolerasul/2019/02/28/on-the-eve-of-maple-syrup-season-a-snapshot-of-the-growing-american-market/#144176233b0e). Though there are many advanced techniques available to the farmers in the extraction process, if the climate alters drastically then there will be no maple syrup for pancakes for the future generations.
