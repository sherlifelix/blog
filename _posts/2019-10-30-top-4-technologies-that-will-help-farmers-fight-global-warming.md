Global warming is one of the most dangerous events that the planet Earth is facing at least until NASA discovers an asteroid heading right at us. We as humans have been cultivating crops since stone age. Over the years, agriculture has been modernized but never really threatened. But now with global warming, the increasing temperature and [scarcity of water](https://www.toknowisgood.com/2019/06/28/top-5-cities-to-run-out-of-fresh-drinking-water.html) is beginning to show its impact on the agricultural output in many nations. Like how some [animals have adapted to global warming](https://www.toknowisgood.com/2019/10/21/top-4-animals-that-are-trying-their-best-to-adapt-to-climate-change.html), humans need to improvise to sustain the yield from the crops cultivated and lead a [healthy life](https://www.toknowisgood.com/2019/08/10/top-4-diseases-that-are-on-the-rise-due-to-global-warming.html).

Here are top 4 methods or technologies that will help farmers fight the battle against global warming.

### No–till farming:

Humans have been preparing the soil by various activities as digging, overturning or stirring the earth before they sow the seeds. While this activity might help in shortening the growing season it also makes the soil lose lot of moisture. Hence by avoiding this process, farmers actually allow the soil to retain much of its moisture. This will more likely leave much of soil preparation work to mother nature and [farmer’s animal friends](https://www.toknowisgood.com/2018/10/28/top-6-animals-that-help-farmers-or-agriculture.html). This will also reduce the amount of water needed for the crop, which is a great help in this age of water scarcity.

### Heat tolerant traits

As the temperature increases certain parts of the world go above the acceptable limits for growth of crops. Hence there has been a pressure on governments and scientists to come up with [heat resistant variety of crops](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3728475). In fact, certain group of scientists have been successful at it too. A team from the University of Florida actually did come up with heat resistant variants of wheat and maize that displayed significantly high yield in hot temperatures. In future there might be lot of demands for such genetically modified variants in Tropical areas like Africa and India.

### Drought resistant crops

Global warming has altered weather patterns leading to flood and droughts in many places across the globe. While some have adapted themselves brilliantly to overcome this situation, humans on the other hand still need grains from crops to survive. Hence arises the need to come up with drought resistant variants of crops. While all crops cannot be modified to reduce their need of water, certain crops like maize, which are known to need lesser amount of water than grains like rice, can be modified. In fact, in certain regions of Africa a project called WEMA (Water Efficient Maize for Africa) is being tried out through collaboration of public and private resources. Hope such activities lead to development of crops that will need less water to grow like a [camel](https://www.toknowisgood.com/2019/01/04/animals-that-don-t-drink-water.html)

### Crop Protection

Another important area to be focused on in the future will be [crop protection](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/crop-protection). As we discussed, we might have already seen the best years of agricultural yield and are looking ahead on tough times. Right now as per estimates and studies, we lose 40% of our crops to insects, weeds or diseases. One of the primary reasons is the fact that certain geographies which were not habitable by insects have now become hospitable due to increase in temperature. This will continue to increase in the future and hence we as humans will need to innovate and stress more on the initiatives to save the yield or crop that we cultivate.

These four methods or practices should help the farmers in a big way to continue practicing profitable and sustainable farming in the tough years to come.
