The Oxford comma is the final comma while listing things. It is a comma before the conjunction ‘and’. It serves an important purpose of making a sentence more understandable and helps deliver the right meaning to the reader.

The Oxford comma is also known as the 'serial comma' or Harvard Comma. The word comma derives its origin from the Greek word koptein meaning “to cut off”. A 15th century Italian printer named Aldus Manutius was the person who introduced the Oxford comma as way to separate things.

It is not mandatory to use the Oxford comma unless you are writing for publications who are very specific about this.
Example: I love my parents, Ed Sheeran and godfather
The above sentence, without the Oxford comma gives out the meaning that you love your parents and your parents being Ed Sheeran and Godfather

Same sentence when re-written with the Oxford Comma gives out the meaning clearly.
I love my parents, Ed Sheeran, and Godfather

People who are not pleased with the Oxford comma, suggests rephrasing such confusing sentences to make it clear 
I love Ed Sheeran, Godfather and my parents

Even though the Oxford comma does look like it is solving a lot of problems, not everyone feels comfortable in using it. People in Canada are so against it for instance and it is not widely used in British English as well.
