Global warming has been hard on all of us. We as humans though have been fortunate enough to have access to various technological advancements that help us adapt to the increasing weather and its effects. We can even manage to survive [dangerous diseases](https://www.toknowisgood.com/2019/08/10/top-4-diseases-that-are-on-the-rise-due-to-global-warming.html) that can spread due to this change with the technological advancements. Animals on the other hand are forced to take the brunt rather directly. While a lot of species are being threatened towards extinction, there are few that have rather managed to find new ways to wade through these tough times.

The top 4 species that have managed to find innovative solutions are as follows:

## Lung fish

Global warming has helped increasing the water levels in the ocean. But the same cannot be said of its fresh water counterparts. [Global warming has not been kind](https://www.toknowisgood.com/2019/06/28/top-5-cities-to-run-out-of-fresh-drinking-water.html) towards many marshes and reservoirs. The everchanging weather patterns induced by the increasing temperature has cut many of their reservoirs from their supply and hence they are forced to go through extended periods of drought. The animals or fish that thrive in these waters hence are forced to find ways to survive. One such successful animal is the [lung fish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lungfish). The fish has managed to figure out a way to live in Land! Yes, thatâ€™s true. The lungfish has been able to use its bladder as lungs to breathe air. This modification has enabled the fish to survive droughts by hiding under the mud and breathing in air. It can survive up to 5 years under the mud by breathing air and thus escaping the ill effects of global warming.

## Storks
Another species that is figuring its way through global warming is the stork. The creature that in cartoons has been thought to [deliver babies](https://www.livescience.com/62807-why-storks-baby-myth.html) due to its [migratory capabilities](https://www.toknowisgood.com/2018/10/27/animal-migrations.html) is now changing its legendary capability to survive global warming. Storks have been noticed recently to change their migratory calendar or even not migrate when they sense the season to be not suitable. When the winter is not too cold they prefer to just stay back and breed. But the surprising fact here is even if the parents did not migrate the baby storks still manage when the need arises. This makes the stork a successful adapter to the change in weather.

## Polar and Grizzly bear
We have mentioned in another article, the sufferings of the polar bear and how they are starving to death due to global warming. But it doesn’t mean that they are not trying their best to extend the survival of the species. Global warming has made the polar bear wander more on land than on ice. This has brought the polar bear closer to its North American relative the grizzly bear. Though they are entirely different species there have been multiple instances of [cross breeding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grizzly%E2%80%93polar_bear_hybrid) between these two species.  This, though not uncommon among animals, has helped the polar bear to continue its genes in the era of increasing temperatures.

## Water Flea
Another creature successful at adapting has been the water flea. The water flea is a species that doesn’t need two sexes to breed. It reproduces through a method called [parthenogenesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parthenogenesis) which just needs female sex cells to get fertilized on its own. But the process is a lot dependent on the right weather. Using the weather as an indicator, the flea has been able to reproduce in large numbers in warm weather and less in winter. This tells researchers that the species can read and change according to the weather and the abundance of water. Some other species are also able to do this
