title: Top 4 animals that are trying their best to adapt to climate change
---

Global warming has been hard on all of us. We as humans though have been fortunate enough to have access to various technological advancements that help us adapt to the increasing weather and its effects. We can even manage to survive [dangerous diseases](https://www.toknowisgood.com/2019/08/10/top-4-diseases-that-are-on-the-rise-due-to-global-warming.html) that can spread due to this change with the technological advancements. Animals on the other hand are forced to take the brunt rather directly. While a lot of species are being threatened towards extinction, there are few that have rather managed to find new ways to wade through these tough times.

The top 4 species that have managed to find innovative solutions are as follows:

## Lung fish

Global warming has helped increasing the water levels in the ocean. But the same cannot be said of its fresh water counterparts. [Global warming has not been kind](https://www.toknowisgood.com/2019/06/28/top-5-cities-to-run-out-of-fresh-drinking-water.html) towards many marshes and reservoirs. The everchanging weather patterns induced by the increasing temperature has cut many of their reservoirs from their supply and hence they are forced to go through extended periods of drought. The animals or fish that thrive in these waters hence are forced to find ways to survive. One such successful animal is the [lung fish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lungfish). The fish has managed to figure out a way to live in Land! Yes, thatâ€™s true. The lungfish has been able to use its bladder as lungs to breathe air. This modification has enabled the fish to survive droughts by hiding under the mud and breathing in air. It can survive up to 5 years under the mud by breathing air and thus escaping the ill effects of global warming.
