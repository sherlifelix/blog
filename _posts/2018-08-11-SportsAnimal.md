Unlike the rodeo sport practised in the US, Chilean rodeo does not involve riding or roping the bull by a single participant. The Chilean rodeo involves two participants ( huasos) riding on horses attempting to steer a calf onto the cushions laid on the sides of the arena. Every right attempt earns them points but a failed attempt , steering the calf against the sides, results in deduction of points. The sport enjoys cult following in the rural regions of the country.
