Auto rickshaws have been commonly used in Italy since the 40s as means of low cost transportation when the country was suffering economically post the second world war. Piaggio Ape designed by the Vespa creator is still famous in the country. Though the primary purpose is freight transport it is still used for transporting people in the rural parts of the country. Autorickshaws played an important role in getting the economy back on track for Italy after the world war and hence they are still being remembered very fondly by the Italians and take pride in them
