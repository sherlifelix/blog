## USA

For a country that has excellent roads, USA also has one of the highest number of deaths due to road accidents in the world. The annual fatality due to road accidents is around 35000. USA is the only developed nation in the list which shows that the cause of road accident is not the infracture but the recklessness of the drivers that is leading to such a high fatality. Recently of late the government is taking stringent action against traffic offenses

## Nigeria

Nigeria, the developing African nation loses approximately 36000 lives to road accidents every year. This developing nation does not boast the best of roads and its roads are crowded most of the time. But itâ€™s the negligence of the vehicle maintenance and lack of vehicle maintenance regulation that is leading to fatalities.

## Indonesia

This developing Asian nation has one of the highest fatality rates in the world and its increasing too. Around 38000 lives are lost a year. The improving economy has led to a sharp increase in the number of vehicles on roads that simple do not meet the safety levels.

## Brazil

Road transport is not the best if you are a tourist out to explore this beautiful latin American nation. The lack of proper road infrastructure and aggressive driving of the locals is the cause of this increase in accidents in the nation. The estimated fatalities is around 41000.

## India

With more than 200,000 fatalities and more in near fatalities, Indian roads are quite the reason for deaths. One can blame the Indian infrastructure and lack of safety standards of the vehicles as the primary concern. For a country of more than 1 billion population, this number might be very less, but the government rightly has started acting upon them by instructing the auto manufacturers to improve their safety features in the vehicles and also is working on improving the infrastructure.

## China

The country with the highest population in the world is also the place with the highest number of road fatalities. China loses more than 250,000 lives a year to road accidents. One of the main reasons for the same is that the citizens consider the traffic signals and rules optional. For someone from the western nations it would be a complete chaos!!
