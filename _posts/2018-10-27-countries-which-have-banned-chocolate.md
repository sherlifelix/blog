Now we all know that Singapore is a very clean country. That is achieved not without any sacrifices by its citizens. The humble chewing gum is banned in the country as it might hamper its cleanliness. 

## Sweden:

Another beautiful country no doubt!! But the chocolate that is banned is not chewing gum but M&M. Yes you heard it right.  Mondelez another chocolate company is already selling a brand called M. Hence to avoid confusion the country has banned M&Ms

## USA:

The kinder surprise eggs are not available in the United States. Yes the food and drug administration of the country has deemed it a choking hazard. The hidden toy in the chocolate is the reason for this. However once can still find the kinder joy which is another variation of the same chocolate

## European union:##
